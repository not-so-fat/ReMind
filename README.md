# ReMind

## Repeat to Remind

ReMind helps you remember things through repetitive quiz training.
It's simple, playful, and customizable.

## Getting Started

To set up and run ReMind, see:
- **Windows users**: See `WINDOWS_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions
- **Ubuntu/Linux users**: See `UBUNTU_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions
- **macOS users**: See `webapp/README.md` for setup instructions

## What You Can Do?

### What to Memorize

Register pairs of words/phrases you want to remember e.g. English words and their Japanese meanings. 

### Practice

ReMind shows you one word with several answer choices. Pick the correct match. 
If you think an answer should also be accepted, you can send feedback too.

### Review

Review quizes with these categories
- New (you haven't practiced these yet)
- Wandering (your results haven't been good enough)
- Confident (your results have been good!)
