# ReMind

## Repeat to Remind

ReMind helps you remember things through repetitive quiz training.
It's simple, playful, and customizable.

## What You Can Do?

### What to Memorize

Register pairs of words/phrases you want to remember e.g. English words and their Japanese meanings. 

### Practice

ReMind shows you one word with several answer choices. Pick the correct match. 
If you think an answer should also be accepted, you can send feedback too.

### Review

Review quizes with these categories
- New (you haven't practiced these yet)
- Wandering (your results haven't been good enough)
- Confident (your results have been good!)
